Welcome! 

[View Online](https://wes-o.github.io/turn-theme/)

To get started immediately: 

1. Fork and clone the [Turn Theme repo](https://github.com/wes-o/turn-theme): `git clone https://github.com/wes-o/turn-theme`
2. [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/): `gem install jekyll`
3. Install the theme's dependencies: `bundle install`
4. Customize theme (see instructions below)
5. Run the Jekyll server: ` bundle exec jekyll serve`


## Fast Installation

A few scripts are provided to speed up your development workflow:

First off: 
`git clone https://www.github.com/wes-o/turn-theme`

`cd turn-theme` into the project then in your terminal/command prompt..  

	// dependencies 
	$ script/bootstrap

	// test build status
	$ script/build

	// start the Jekyll server at localhost:4000
	$ script/server 

How fast was that for you?


Maybe you would like more clarification. That's fine!

## Detailed Installation 

Make a new directory for a Jekyll site, a new Ruby Gem, then add the line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

	$ jekyll new jekyll-site && cd jekyll-site 

Edit your `Gemfile` as:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem 'github-pages'
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: 
    title: Turn Theme
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install 
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install turn-theme

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just like a Jekyll site!

## Sass Usage 

Please follow this directory structure when making a pull request:

	_layout.scss

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `turn-theme.gemspec` accordingly.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
